# OpenML-Labs

Hi, we are the [Automated Machine Learning research group](https://openml-labs.github.io) at [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/)!

The team consists of PhDs, postdocs, and research engineers, with Joaquin Vanschoren at the helm. We do fundamental research on AI and how to make it useful for people. This includes Automated Machine Learning to build models automatically for you, open-source large language models and multi-modal foundation models that you can easily adapt to your needs, continual learning and meta-learning to learn fast from little data, and many more. We also build open-source AI tools used by millions of people, such as [OpenML](https://www.openml.org), [Croissant](https://github.com/mlcommons/croissant), and datasets like [MetaAlbum](https://meta-album.github.io/).
